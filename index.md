#### Lab 05 

     During my process in Lab 5 part 1 and 2, I will admit it was difficult yet very interesting at the same time. It was one of my favorite labs because both parts of the lab involved using mathematics which was a big challenge to figure out but the overall result was satisfying to see at the end. I was able to figure out how to use both doubles and integers in coding as well as implementing them in loops which was really fun as well.
