# Lizbeth Flores Portfolio

Welcome to my Homepage! My name is Lizbeth Flores and I am a student at [California State of Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/), where I study in Computer Science as my intended major.

### Lab 05 

     During my process in Lab 5 part 1 and 2, I will admit it was difficult, 
     yet very interesting at the same time. It was one of my favorite labs 
     because both parts of the lab involved using mathematics which was a
     big challenge to figure out but the overall result was satisfying to 
     see at the end. I was able to figure out how to use both doubles and 
     integers in coding as well as implementing them in loops which was really 
     fun as well. 

### Lab 08 

     I will mostly point out that Lab 08 in part 1 is truly my favorite 
     work to do. It was about creating an order of sandwiches with arguments.
     Where we were able to prompt the code to have three arguments for the 
     input to get the expected output in making the preferred sandwich we
     wrote down as an argument input.

### Lab 09 

     Lab 09 on part 1, is about the Olympic Judge Average. Where it involved
    writing a function that is able to write the average of the Athletics
    average mean in any elements of vectors except their minimum and maximum.
    I will admit this lab was also a big challenge and I needed a lot of help
    with my partner, however it was really impressive to see how we use many
    functions to calculate and find the average mean by using a averaging 
    algorithm.
